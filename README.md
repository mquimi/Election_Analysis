# Election_Analysis with Python

### 1. Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

For this project, I was in charge of an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. In order to audit the election, I had to use Python 3. With the help of python, I was able to write the script and perform the following tasks:

Total number of votes
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
The voter turnout for each county
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
The county with the highest turnout


### 2. Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

### 3. Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
