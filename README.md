# Election_Analysis with Python

### 1. Overview of Election Audit:

For this project, I was in charge of an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. With the help of python, I was able to write the script and perform the following tasks for the analysis:

- Total number of votes
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout


### 2. Election-Audit Results:

### 3. Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
