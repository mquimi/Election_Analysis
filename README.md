# Election_Analysis with Python

### 1. Overview of Election Audit:

For this project, I was in charge of an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. With the help of python, I was able to write the script and perform the following tasks for the analysis:

- Total number of votes
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout


### 2. Election-Audit Results: 

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

From the image above, you can conclude that the winner of the election is Diana DeGette with a total of 272,892 vote counts and a winning pecentage of 73.8%
### 3. Election-Audit Summary: 


After creating the python script for the election, I realize that this script is not a one time script and can be modified to meet the criterias that others may want. At the moment, the current script allows users to see the the total amount of votes, who the winner was, what was the largest county and other useful information that can help determine other analysis. 

Two modifications that can be done with this current script is to:

1. analyze data on a larger scale: we can alter the county list to a state list or a list of countries at a specific region. The larger the data, the more complicated it will be, but with the script, it will help users to quickly analyze the data.


2. cadidates' demographics: adding demoegraphics to this script can help our analysis by figuring out which state/country is more appealing to a candidate based on their age, sex, and ethnic background. The more background we know of a person, the more we are likely to trust that person.
